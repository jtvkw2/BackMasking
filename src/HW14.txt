HW14 - BackMasking
Level: Challenge

1. I started with trying different ways to write the dat files into an array and then worked from there.

2. The command line implementation I feel could handle the arguments given in a better manner

3. I found no issues in my test cases, I had some issue with writing to a dat file, but adding a method to create a file
   worked well.

4. The most important thing that I learned from this assignment was how to implement the same outputs with information from
   the user on how it is going to be done.

5. Next time I would work more on my handling of command line arguments.

Sample1 - To infinity and beyond

Sample 2 - Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain

Sample 3 - What we've got here is a failure to communicate
